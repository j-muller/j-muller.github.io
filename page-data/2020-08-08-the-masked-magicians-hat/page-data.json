Company. The famous Masked Magician (whose retreat in Alaska in the 80s stays a complete mystery in the eyes of the world), leaves us his hat of a thousand tricks, in spite of it all.</em></p>\n<p>Manufactured in thin felt by expert hindi craftspersons, made in short alpaga wool with long and tight links, this hat will ensure warmth and confort to its wearer. But also, he would make his life better and convey him a perpetual luck (at least that’s what the Masked Magician used to say, before he tripped on the steps of the Sacré Coeur in 1991 and before a microlight crashed on his car on a dark evening in winter 1997).</p>\n<p>This hat has been seen these past years in<br>\nLa Grande Illusion<br>\n, an escape game adventure by<br>\nThe Box<br>\n, in Metz, France. It’s all about magic, and you might expect as many surprises in this room as there are impromptu wine gatherings along the Canal St Martin when the sun shines.</p>\n<p>Item in mint condition, original tag braided by hand Price :  5 200 £ Please contact us if interested</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Masked Magician’s hat","author":"Les Francs Limiers","date":"2020-08-08T00:20:00.000Z","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0526315789473684,"src":"/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/2f1b1/headline.jpg","srcSet":"/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/fd013/headline.jpg 200w,\n/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/25252/headline.jpg 400w,\n/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/2f1b1/headline.jpg 800w,\n/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/0ff54/headline.jpg 1200w,\n/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/06655/headline.jpg 1600w,\n/static/11cac63840d24e8cc0c9285e2dd5303a/a8953/headline.jpg 1986w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","slug":"2020-08-08-the-masked-magicians-hat","language":"en","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","fr"],"defaultLanguage":"en","routed":false,"resources":{"en":{"translation":{"The H.E.L.L.
