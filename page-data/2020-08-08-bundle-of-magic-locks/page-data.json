In the finest “Sésame ouvre toi” style, remarkably precise, for the lock aficionados.</em></p>\n<p>The Safe lock</p>\n<p>Let’s start for the first lock, which lovers know well. Often attached on bridges, it has the power to lock you loved one to your heart, or to make them come back. But it also requires one or two rituals, or some help from a specialist (I can give you the number of some of my well-informed coworkers).</p>\n<p>The Old-fashioned lock</p>\n<p>The usual, good ol’key lock (note that if you dip it in venom or curare,  you will definitely disconcert the user). The key will probably come with it, but if not, I can send you a slightly rusty but efficient lock picking kit.</p>\n<p>The Safe lock</p>\n<p>Another timeless classic in this bundle : the safe lock. Use it wisely and only with the user manual, because it can get really annoying. A turn to the left, two turns to the right, a combination, a prayer and you will be the happy owner of an incredible protection token. Your secrets will be safe.</p>\n<p>The Compass lock</p>\n<p>This lock is extremely powerful, for it’s protected by a disorientation spell. If you don’t have the right pattern, well, tough !</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bundle of magic locks","author":"Les Francs Limiers","date":"2020-08-08T00:35:00.000Z","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0526315789473684,"src":"/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/2f1b1/headline.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/fd013/headline.jpg 200w,\n/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/25252/headline.jpg 400w,\n/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/2f1b1/headline.jpg 800w,\n/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/0ff54/headline.jpg 1200w,\n/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/06655/headline.jpg 1600w,\n/static/ca5cee64d8c3af49e2804e41b9c64158/a8953/headline.jpg 1986w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","slug":"2020-08-08-bundle-of-magic-locks","language":"en","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","fr"],"defaultLanguage":"en","routed":false,"resources":{"en":{"translation":{"The H.E.L.L.
